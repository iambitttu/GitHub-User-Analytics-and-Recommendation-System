# GitHub-User-Analytics-and-Recommendation-System

## Overview

This project aims to collect data from GitHub users, store it in MongoDB, and create an analytics dashboard to understand users' technical strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, a recommendation system is built to suggest users with similar technological interests.

## Features

### Data Collection

- Utilizes the GitHub API to fetch user data, handling API rate limits and incorporating error handling strategies.
- Stores collected data in MongoDB in a structured format.
- Implements batch collection to fetch at least 1000 users' data efficiently.

### Analytics Dashboard

- Retrieves user data from MongoDB for analysis.
- Displays user statistics such as the number of repositories, commits, and languages used.
- Visualizes data with graphs showing popular languages, average commits, etc.
- Provides individual profile analytics to visualize strengths and weaknesses in terms of technologies used.
- Offers interactivity allowing users to search for specific GitHub profiles and view analytics.
- Hosts and deploys the dashboard onto a web app server (e.g., Heroku, Render.com).

### Recommendation System

- Processes user data to derive features such as languages used and frequency of commits.
- Builds a recommendation system using techniques such as collaborative filtering or cosine similarity to suggest users with similar interests.
- Integrates the recommendation system into the dashboard, allowing users to view and explore recommendations.
